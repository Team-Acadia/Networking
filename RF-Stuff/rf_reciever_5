#This code listens for an RF signal from 3 different vibration sensors reporting a fall. At rest, the RF reciever reads noise, random 0s and 1s.
#Therefore, a fall cannot just be signalled by a high pulse from a sensor, so each has an ID it sends in binary
#Also, each vibration sensor's output signal is varried in time so their signals don't collide.
